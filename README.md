# Extract_MRO
Code to extract and analyze MRO data


The file "extract MRO data" get the data and analyze it. 
The file "mars maptest" is used to get Mars map with different informations from "extract MRO data". Be careful, it uses pygmt, and you have to install it in a virtual environment made for pygmt or you will have dependency problems.
The two files were made on windows, with anaconda and jupyter notebook. I haven't tested them on Linux or MacOS. 

Feel free to contact me if any problem arises.
